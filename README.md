I am the author and founder of Unity for Good Living Initiative

WHAT'S UNITY FOR  GOOD LIVING INITIATIVE?
Unity for Good Living Initiative is our initiative, project and book of my Action and Compassion Books, to encourage everyone for good.

Only five years remaining before the target of SDGs, how can SDGs be accomplished within these five years? How can poverty and hunger be reduced in Africa and the world, even in these climate change challenges? To optimize leadership and folowership to encourage more SDGs projects and programs will do much. Let's unite in Unity for Good Living Initiative.

​Our two general goals are:
1 SDGs by all and for all: Encouraging everyone to volunteer in at least one SDGs, and consequently making everyone to benefit from SDGs.
2 To optimize leadership and folowership for establishing most needful projects for citizens.

Our ​two quotes:
“The numerous small good done by many people, make the big good that saves the world”.
“ We are all poor until we offer love and care for each other, the everlasting wealth we possess is the love and care we offer each other.” ​

Our one ​liner words are:
The book encouraging numerous projects for a holistic and common good.

I am sure we now have the understanding that Unity for Good Living Initiative is fully decentralized into groups in both religious and non religious environment and I the author and founder of Unity for Good Living Initiative will not raise funds for any project, fund raising may take place at various groups, but my impact will depend on the patronage of my Action and Compassion Books business. I describe Unity for Good Living Initiative as dapps, that should be coordinated by religious leaders. I hope to see a world where everyone will realize the worship of a true God (Love) as a journey of repentance from selfishness (making the satisfaction of the desires of one's flesh a priority) to selfishness (denying the desires of one's flesh to achieve good as a priority).

WHY AM I OUTSTANDING FOR REWARDS?
I am outstanding for rewards because despite my unique Unity for Good Living Initiative, I have also passed Hedera certification course with a score of 78% and I am also aware of my team member (Paulo-prop) that is also Hedera certified.
